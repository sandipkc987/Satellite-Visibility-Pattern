# Starlink Satellite Visibility Pattern
## Overview
In the code, an idealized set of 1584 TLEs is used to model the Starlink 
first shell, derived from Starlink-1019 (NORAD ID: 44724). Unlike real TLEs 
which account for satellites launched incrementally and orbital planes drifting 
over time due to atmospheric drag and station-keeping maneuvers, the ideal 
Walker-Delta simulation distributes all satellites uniformly with perfect 
spacing across 72 orbital planes.

This is why the simulation shows **26–35 visible satellites simultaneously**, 
instead of the real-world **6–12**. This is the limitation of the ideal 
constellation assumption.

> **Note:** A TLE (Two-Line Element set) is a snapshot of a satellite's orbit 
at a specific moment in time.

## TLE Epoch and Simulation Window
The Starlink-1019 TLE epoch of **August 21, 2021** was used to extract the 
shell-defining orbital parameters for the Walker-Delta Model. The simulation 
was conducted over a **3-hour window on August 20, 2025**. Satellite positions 
were determined by propagating those parameters using MATLAB's satellite 
scenario framework.

### Reference Orbital Parameters — Starlink-1019
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Inclination | 53.0546 deg |
| RAAN | 102.5261 deg |
| Eccentricity | 0.0002146 |
| Arg. of Perigee | 68.2315 deg |
| Mean Anomaly | 291.8902 deg |
| Mean Motion | 15.06408494 rev/day |
| Rev at Epoch | 97740 |

## Orbital Radius Calculation
Orbital radius is determined from the mean motion using Kepler's Third Law.

**Step 1 — Convert mean motion to rad/s:**

n = 15.06408494 × (2π / 86400) = 0.001740 rad/s

**Step 2 — Apply Kepler's Third Law (gravitational = centripetal force):**

r = (μ / n²) ^ (1/3)

Where μ = 3.986004418 × 10¹⁴ m³/s² (Earth gravitational parameter)

**Result:** Orbital radius = **6921 km** from Earth's center → **550 km altitude**

Since the eccentricity of Starlink-1019 is approximately 0.0002146, the orbit 
is treated as circular. The difference between perigee and apogee is only 3 km 
out of 6921 km — a variation of just **0.04%** — which is negligible for 
constellation modelling. The semi-major axis is therefore used as a constant 
orbital radius throughout the simulation.

## Walker-Delta Constellation Geometry
| Symbol | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| T | 1584 | Total Satellites |
| P | 72 | Number of Orbital Planes |
| F | 1 | Phasing Factor |

- **Plane spacing:** 360 / 72 = **5 degrees** between consecutive planes  
- **In-plane spacing:** 360 / 22 = **16.36 degrees** between satellites  
- **Phase offset:** 0.2273 degrees per plane — prevents all planes crossing 
the equator simultaneously

## Satellite Naming Convention
Each satellite is labeled as:
```
STARLINK-1019 P{plane}-S{slot}
```
For example, **STARLINK-1019 P22-S03** = Plane 22, Slot 3 of the modeled 
Starlink first shell.

## Ground Station — Irving, Texas
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Latitude | 32.8140° N |
| Longitude | 96.9489° W |
| Altitude | 0 m (ground level) |
| Min Elevation Angle | 10 degrees |

A satellite is visible from Irving if it satisfies **both** conditions:
1. The satellite is above the horizon
2. The satellite is at least **10 degrees** above the horizon

---

## Orbit Number Calculation
Orbit number at any simulation time is estimated by extrapolating from the 
TLE epoch:

OrbitNum = floor(RevAtEpoch + MeanMotion × ΔT)

**Example for August 20, 2025:**
- ΔT = Aug 20, 2025 − Aug 17, 2021 ≈ **1464 days**
- Additional orbits = 15.064 × 1464 ≈ **22,054 orbits**
- OrbitNum = 97740 + 22054 = **119,794**

The `floor()` function is used because orbit number must be a whole number.

## Handover Strategies

### Strategy 1 — Highest Elevation Angle 
The satellite with the highest elevation angle is selected as the serving 
satellite. At lower elevation angles the signal travels a longer atmospheric 
path — at 10 degrees elevation the path is approximately **5.76× longer** 
than at zenith, causing greater attenuation and degraded link quality.

## Highest Elevation Handover — How It Works

At each 30-second timestep, the algorithm goes through the following steps
to decide which satellite should be serving Irving:

### Step 1 — Find all visible satellites
The binary access matrix is checked at the current timestep. Any satellite
with a value of 1 (visible and above 10-degree minimum elevation) is added
to the candidate list.

### Step 2 — Compute elevation angles
The `aer()` function (azimuth-elevation-range) is called once across all
visible satellites simultaneously to get their current elevation angles.
The satellite sitting highest above the horizon is identified as the
best candidate.

### Step 3 — Apply the hysteresis guard
Before switching, two conditions must both be true at the same time:

| Condition | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Candidate must beat current satellite's elevation by | > 5 degrees |
| Current satellite must have been serving for at least | 10 timesteps = 300 seconds |

If either condition is not met, the terminal **stays on the current
satellite** even if a higher one is available. This prevents excessive
ping-pong handovers caused by two satellites crossing the same elevation
angle every 30 seconds.

### Step 4 — Forced handover (exception)
If the serving satellite drops **below the 10-degree minimum elevation
mask**, the hysteresis guard is bypassed completely and the terminal
immediately switches to the best available satellite regardless of dwell
time or elevation margin.

### Step 5 — Record the result
The serving satellite and its elevation are recorded for that timestep.
Consecutive timesteps with the same satellite are later merged into a
single interval showing start time, end time, duration, and elevation
range.

### Why highest elevation?
At lower elevation angles the signal travels a longer path through the
atmosphere. At 10-degree elevation the atmospheric path is approximately
**5.76 times longer** than at zenith, causing greater signal attenuation
and degraded link quality. Selecting the highest elevation satellite
minimises this path length at every moment.

### Hysteresis parameters used
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Elevation improvement threshold | 5.0 degrees |
| Minimum dwell time | 10 timesteps (300 seconds) |
| Sample interval | 30 seconds |
| Minimum elevation mask | 10 degrees |

### Strategy 2 — Longest Visual Time
Selects the satellite with the most remaining visibility time above the ground 
station. The terminal stays connected until the satellite drops below the 
horizon — **forced handovers only, no voluntary switching.**

- Minimises total handover count by design  
- Tiebreaker: highest elevation among satellites with equal remaining windows  
- Matches the strategy in: *Romero et al., Handover Management and Doppler 
Shift Compensation in Satellite Communications, University of North Texas*  
- Paper finding: longest visual strategy outperforms strongest-signal when 
handover delay exceeds **130 ms**
